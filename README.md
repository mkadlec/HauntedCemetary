The goal of this program was to teach my son (aged 6) how to read (using pretty basic words), do a little math, and have fun.

This simple ruby program will take a kid through some Choose-your-own-adventure scenarios and hopefully have some fun.

The story is a work in progress, so some choices just lead back to the beginning.  Hopefully I can add more (or others can fork and add more story).
